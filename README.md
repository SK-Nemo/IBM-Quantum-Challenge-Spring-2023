# IBM-Quantum-Challenge-Spring-2023
This repository contains my solutions for the IBM Quantum Challenge Spring 2023.  Lab 1 is a crash course in to dynamic circuits, Lab 2 goes through quantum teleportation, Lab 3 focuses on iterative phase estimation, and Lab 4 runs us through quantum error correction, and Lab 5 allows us to set up a GHz state for use on a 127-qubit system
